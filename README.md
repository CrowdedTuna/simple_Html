# Simple Html

---

- html is a very intuitive *(and precise)* coding language. taking advantage of javascript and cascading style sheets (of css for short)

# starting out
---

- for a simple line of code, just start out like this,
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>ADD TEXT HERE</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>My First Website!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
- And just like that, your very first lines of code!!!
- But the fun doesn't stop there. there are so many possibilities. with html, the limit is your imagination!
